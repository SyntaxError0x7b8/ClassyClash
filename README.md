This project was made following the tutorial found at:
https://www.gamedev.tv/courses/cpp-fundamentals

There are some differences compared to the course, so I had the opportunity to learn other C++ features.

for the CMake file, I modified a templete created by tupin07
https://github.com/tupini07/raylib-cpp-cmake-template/blob/main/CMakeLists.txt

This project is created and tested  in CLion on Ubuntu 24.04

Last thing: see original developers for copyright stuff.
